# Data Analysis Interface

This project is a concept webapp with the goal of providing an easy-to-use interface so that data from a bussiness is introduced on a regular basis and stored so that further processing can be made.

## Overview

It is based on node.js and express for the backend and react+redux for the frontend. By now data is stored on a json file but itÂ´s planned to move to mongoDB when getting closer to production. By now it is just a proof of concept, but it is expected to eventually be released. Its main target is small bussinesses which want an easy solution for data storage and analysis.

Keep in mind this is just a simple input-storage app, and still no processing is made. 

## Structure

The app is divided in two subrepositories, corresponding to the backend and frontend.
